first arrived in US 1881 (don’t know anything really from before)
left at some point back to China
came back to US in 1891, must have already had a partnership then but we haven’t found it
1893 Wing Sing Gue, not the main guy (Lee Dick is), Courtland CA
1899, not in wing sing gue anymore
1900, joins Chong Sing &amp; Co in Walnut Grove CA
1902, becomes main guy of Chong Sing &amp; Co, most others go back to China (including Lee Dick)
sometime 1902-03, goes back to China
1903 came with wife Jang Hem/Jeung Hem (”start of our family history”) and older of their two daughters other had an eye infection, came later with her husband and eventual infant daughter
immigration wouldn’t let Jang Hem off the boat at first, WMC wrote to W. A. Smith of Levis 1904 first daughter born in US is born (Sam Foon)
1905 second daughter born in US is born (Dorothy, Chuck Yee)
1906 earthquake, brought vegetables to the SF chinatown from walnut grove
Sept 1906, first picture with hair grown out (anti-Qing) on partnership paper
1909 moved to watsonville, June 22, 1909 bought over dry goods store Wong Yee Kee Company (219 Main St. Watsonville, previously Yee Lee Company, a gambling den that got busted and got racist press coverage)
c. 1916 photo in front of the store has the second daughter and family when they were visiting. Wanted to stay but were rejected (deemed “unfavorable” on immigration paper), stayed in Canada a while before going back to China
May 1919 since then becomes officially sole owner (was really the sole owner except when he listed brother in law for when daughter was visiting)
1921 sold business and land (how did he own property?) and left for China with family (wife, 5 kids). Said he might come back in 5 years, but never did, spent rest of life in Shanghai. Filled out the 431 Form, stating they are leaving and intend on coming back
WMC actually hired a lawyer
Also part of the process was an interview where they got personal information that they would have to reproduce upon re-entry. Paperwork that exists: executive summary of interview, letter of approval (or disapproval), and transcribed interview
Brought money back with him (bank statement)
